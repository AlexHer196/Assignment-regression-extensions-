**1. The attached wages.xlsx Download wages.xlsxdataset contains data on the hourly wage, age, and education of 80 workers at a single manufacturing firm. You are interested in whether age has a quadratic effect on predicted wages.**

*a. Plot Wage against Age and evaluate whether a linear or quadratic model would better capture the relationship.*

*b. Estimate a multiple regression model of Wage using Age and Education as independent (X) variables; assume a standard linear relationship between Wage and Age.*

*c. Estimate another multiple regression model of Wage using Age and Education as independent (X) variables; this time fit Age using a quadratic relationship. Verify your choice from part a. by comparing the distribution of residuals and the goodness of fit between the models in parts b and c.*

*d. Use the appropriate model to predict hourly wages for someone with 16 years of education and age equal 30, 50, or 70.*

*e. According to the model, at what age will someone with 16 years of education attain the highest wages?*

**2. The AnnArbor.xlsx Download AnnArbor.xlsxfile contains data on a portion of the rental market in Ann Arbor, MI. The data includes the monthly rent, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, and the square footage of 40 rental properties.**

*a. Plot Rent against each of the three predictor variables and evaluate whether the relationship is best captured by a line or a curve. Identify variables that may benefit from a log-transformation.*

*b. Estimate a multiple regression model (with any appropriate log-transformations) to predict rent for a 1,600-square-foot rental with 3 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms.*
